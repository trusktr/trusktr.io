                This is a recursive descent recognizer that tests whether or not an input string
                is described by the BNF grammar below (in english: this tool
                tests whether a sequence of characters match the format that
                we've specified by the ruleset below). In this case, if the string of characters
                form a proper arithmetic expression (with the exception that only the numbers 0 through 3, the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators, and properly matched parentheses can be used, while no variables are allowed), the string passes,
                otherwise it fails. For example, the string
                <span class="inlinecode">2+(3-1)*2</span> passes while the string
                <span class="inlinecode">2-*6(3</span> obviously does not.
            </p>

<p>Here's the BNF grammar:</p>

<pre class="in">
EXP    ::= EXP  + TERM   | EXP - TERM    | TERM
TERM   ::= TERM * FACTOR | TERM / FACTOR | FACTOR
FACTOR ::= ( EXP ) | DIGIT
DIGIT  ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
</pre>

            <p>
            This was a fun project. I chose to implement this with JavaScript to make the
            recognizer update the valid/not-valid message while you type, in real time.
            JavaScript's event-oriented nature is great for creating these types of live
            interactions. This demonstration runs entirely in the browser; it doesn't communicate with a server at all
            (though in real life you should <i>always</i> validate on the
            server side to prevent malicious attacks if your web app will be sending the data to your server).
            </p>

            <p>
            One of the caveats I encountered is that JavaScript doesn't use pointers, so instead I created a counter
            to count the position of the characters in the input string, then I used JavaScript's .charAt(n) method on the string
            to get each characters, where n is the character's 0-based position in the string.
            </p>

            <p>
            One thing I could improve is to make the global variables private and pass them into my functions, but for now the functions
            accept no arguments. xD

            Here's a great resource on how recursive descent recognizers work:
            <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm">engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm</a>.
            It's what I used to get me started, and it was the first thing that
            popped up on Google when I searched for "recursive descent
            recognizer". I learned from this resource when I did PL Homework 1. As it turns out though, I had to make a significant
            amount of modifications when it came time to actually writing this with real code. The main issue I encountered is that
            the resource didn't really cover how to keep track of matching parenthesis, so I had to make that up from scratch.
